## Description of algorithm and how to use it

### Phase 1

During Phase 1, I am developing an algorithm to detect the text existing in the images. The detected region will be used for Phase 2 which is text recognition. I am using 'EAST' as the text detector, which in full name it is called ' Efficient and Accurate Scene Text detector'. 

For reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03155

You will need at least OpenCV 3.4.5 or OpenCV 4 to implement the algorithm.
